# Usage

To use this project, you will either want it deployed on a website or running in a live server.
If you are utilizing the live server option through VS code, I would recommend the following addon https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

From there you will be prompted with a page with the red "Generate Password Button"

Do not input criteria into the text box, thsi will not work.

Instead click on the button, below the button you will be prompted for how you want to have the password to be customized.

Afterwards click the red button "Generate Password" to generate your password.

If you get an alert with an error message, you will need to adjust you input as stated in the alert.

If you'd like a different password, either click the button again to get a new password with the same criteria or change the password criteria and click the button again.
